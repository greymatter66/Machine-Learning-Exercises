# Exercises and Projects from Jose Portilla course on Udemy
This repo contains exercises and/or projects I have completed while learning from the Jose Portilla course.
The code contained here is that of a novice (me) and may contain some unintended mistakes.
The comments within the code are typical code related comments and some are thought process comments I use 
to focus my learning on why I'm doing something rather than just following or learning off techniques.
